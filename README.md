# Better-Fishing-Bobber-Sound
Makes Fishing Sound Louder and easier to distinguish with a few sounds to choose from


Issue: barely hear the reel pull
Solution 1: Turn up Friendly Creatures
Soultion 2: Get this Resource Pack

so Kraxics/Ghostheart enforced the idea (work motivation)
Znopp did the hard work of making the sound not change pitch
and I added the a Texturepack Icon
I plan to add more Sound Options to choose from [coming soon...]

The Resource Pack Version is set for 1.21 but should work for most other versions

Current Sound Options

1: Terraria Coin Sound
